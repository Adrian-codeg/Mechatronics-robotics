# Mechatronics-robotics
This is my project for the 'Mechatronics robotics' module of my MSc at University of Sheffield. The course offers us a wide range of skills including CAD, electronic assembly, microcontroller programming, serial communication, and robotic theory. I create this repository long after the project finished.
